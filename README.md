# iRODS Training

This repository holds the training manuals and example codes used in the
iRODS Training sessions led by the iRODS Consortium.

## Beginner

The Beginner training is self contained within a single document.  It leads the student through a scenario and provides step-by-step instructions to explore the breadth of basic iRODS functionality.

It can be found in the ./beginner directory.

If you have pdflatex installed, you can generate the PDF with `make`.

`make clean` will remove any generated files.

## Advanced

The Advanced training assumes a working knowledge and understanding of basic iRODS functionality and terminology.  It is not as self contained, but provides the code examples used by the instructors.  The code examples should be executable.

These materials can be found in the ./advanced directory.
